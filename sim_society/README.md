everyone has 100 $(welfare) at the start. Each year, People has the demand to send their childern to the school, and ther is a greedy officer who will charge them. if one give the money, he will lose 2 $ but gain 5 $ as the child could be educated and the officer will gain 2$; if one doesn't give the money, he will lose 5 $. However, there is some one will nerver compromise to the unjust, therefore, he will never give the money. of course he will lose moeny for that, but one good news is that through news, he will inspire other people to say no to the unjust and of course just increase a little odd(2%).
if there is anyone who is in debt, he is dead, the programme stop. in ever end of the year the data of year will be saved
